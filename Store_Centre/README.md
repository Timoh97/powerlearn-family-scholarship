# NAME OF THE PROJECT
Modern warehouse
# DESCRIPTION
This is a warehouse management web application


## DESIGN
My design practice offers a full range of services including brand strategy, interaction and visual design and user experience testing.
Throughout the project, I design, create and implement visual design and workflows, solicit user feedback and work with you to make sure what gets built is what is needed.

## PRODUCT MANAGEMENT
Planning and development is iterative. Because I am constantly coding and testing, the products I build are always ready to go live. 
This iterative process allows for changes as business requirements evolve.
## DEVELOPMENT
I am a very qualified Engineers,fluent in the latest enterprise and web development technologies.
I collaborate with the team to write, and improve code on a daily basis, using proven practices such as test-driven development and pair programming.
